# The Journey of Plastic: From Production to Ocean Pollution

https://anbunambi3108.github.io/Plastic-Pollution-Visualization-Story/

Since 1950, global plastic production has skyrocketed from just 2 million tons to nearly 460 million tons by 2019, primarily driven by industries such as packaging, and this dramatic increase in production has resulted in a significant rise in plastic waste entering our environment, with rivers transporting millions of tons of mismanaged plastic waste into the oceans, and rivers like the Pasig and the Ulhas are major contributors to ocean plastic pollution, making them critical areas of environmental concern, as the plastic waste carried by these rivers directly threatens marine biodiversity, with many marine animals, including sea turtles, whales, and seabirds, ingesting plastics or becoming entangled in them, causing severe harm to ecosystems and disrupting marine food chains.
